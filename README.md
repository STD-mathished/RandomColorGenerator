## Potential Improvements

This was a fun micro-project. Here are a few ideas to take it further:

* [ ] Add a "Copy to Clipboard" button for the hex code.
* [ ] Support for RGB and HSL color formats.
* [ ] Show a small history of previously generated colors.
* [ ] Ensure a minimum contrast ratio for text (accessibility).
